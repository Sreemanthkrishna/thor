    <p>Online reviews have become an important source of information for users before making an informed purchase decision. Early reviews of a product tend to have a high impact on the subsequent product sales. In this project we have taken the initiative to analyze reviews and characterize early reviewers. In specific, product lifetime is divided into three consecutive stages, namely early, majority and laggards. A user who has posted a review in the early stage is considered as an early reviewer. We quantitatively characterize early reviewers based on their rating behaviors, the helpfulness scores received from others and the correlation of their reviews with product popularity. The project is based on the fact that an early reviewer tends to assign a higher average rating score; and an early reviewer tends to post more helpful reviews. Our analysis of product reviews also indicates that early reviewers’ textual reviews, ratings and their received helpfulness scores are likely to influence product popularity. By viewing review posting process as a multiplayer competition game, we propose a novel margin-based embedding model for early reviewer prediction. This would help the marketing team of a product to effectively be able to sell their product in an e commerce environment.<p>
